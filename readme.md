About my MongoDB Database Application
It is a store with vendors, food categories, and food. There are no customers. Although I have created relationships between the three collections, I did not really have time to showcase those relationships. 

Time permitting I would have checked to make sure that the records could not be changed or deleted if its value was bound to another record.

Extras: 
1. I added links for easier navigation
2. Added buttons to handle POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
3. Created and used error-handling middleware
4. Created EJS files to create a front-end
5. Using EJS, I linked each product/:id to an anchor tag for easier navigation
6. I used Mongoose
